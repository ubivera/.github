## Contribution Workflow

1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Create a branch** for your contribution (`feature/my-enhancement`)
3. Write **modular, testable code** following Clean Architecture principles
4. Add or update **unit and integration tests**
5. Run `dotnet test` or `npm test` and ensure **all tests pass**
6. Commit with a **signed commit** (`git commit -S`)
7. **Open a pull request** to the `main` or appropriate working branch

All PRs will be reviewed for:

- Code quality and test coverage
- Architectural alignment
- Security and compliance concerns
- Adherence to the development guidelines

- Only include changes relevant to the scope of your PR

_By submitting a pull request, you agree to assign all IP in your contribution to Ubivera and affirm that you have the rights to submit the code._
